							<font> [Draft coming soon!]</font></p>   
						<p align = "justify" style= "line-height: 1.3"><font size="-0.5"> Most international trade is invoiced in the US dollar. This paper studies variations in dollar invoicing over time and the role of the global financial cycle. I present three stylized facts about the dynamic movements of invoicing and borrowing currency decisions. First, dollar invoicing shares in exports positively co-move with dollar borrowing shares of firms. Second, both dollar borrowing and dollar invoicing shares positively co-move with the VIX, where dollar borrowing shares are more strongly correlated with the VIX than dollar invoicing shares. Third, countries with higher correlations between shares of dollar borrowing and the VIX also have higher correlations between dollar invoicing shares in exports and the VIX. Based on these stylized facts, I develop a model with dollar borrowing as a key channel that links dollar invoicing in exports and the global financial cycle. The key mechanism is that as dollar borrowing becomes cheaper during the global financial downturns, firms invoice more of their exports in dollars to secure dollar revenues that are used as collateral to increase dollar borrowing. The calibrated model fits the stylized facts well, and also provides additional testable implications.</font></p>

						<p align = "justify"><b>"Tracking Progress Towards the Global COVID-19 Vaccination Targets: An Overview of the WHOIMF Vaccine Tracker"</b>  <i>with Ruchir Agarwal, Ganchimeg Ganpurev, Yunhui Lin and Brandon Joel Tan</i>
							<font><a href="papers/wp_draft.pdf"> [Draft]</a> </font></p>   
						<p align = "justify"style= "line-height: 1.3"><font size="-0.5">The global vaccination targets of 40% coverage in all countries by end-2021, and 70% by mid-2022 were endorsed by multilateral institutions as part of the Multilateral Leaders Task Force and key stakeholders during the US Global COVID-19 Summit in 2021. We introduce the WHO-IMF Vaccine Tracker which measures progress towards these targets along each stage of a vaccine’s journey from procurement, to delivery, and to in- country administration. The objective of the tracker is to identify where gaps in progress towards the targets exists in order to identify what steps need to be taken. As of June 2022, the share of population that has been fully vaccinated is 75%, 78%, 54%, and 14% for HIC, UMIC, LMIC, and LIC groups, respectively. About 86 countries missed the end-2021 40% target. Of 91 AMC countries, about 30 appear to have potential challenges in absorptive capacity. Over 100 countries have missed the mid-2022 70% target, while about 61 of 209 countries have already met the vaccination target.</font></p>

						<p align = "justify"><b>"Corporate Cross-border Borrowing and Macroprudential Policy" </b> 
							<font><a href="papers/cross_border.pdf"> [Draft]</a> </font></p>   
						<p align = "justify"style= "line-height: 1.3"><font size="-0.5">This paper present both empirical and theoretical analyses about the effects of macroprudential policy measures (MPMs). I first examine the effectiveness of MPMs in mitigating the response of corporate loans to a US monetary expansion, using panel data constructed from Dealscan database, IMF macropruden- tial policy index (MPI), and other macro variables. I find that MPMs can effectively attenuate the increase in corporate loans responding to a US monetary expansion, but the effects are dampened as the country’s share of foreign loans goes up. This is because firms borrow more across borders with a decrease in the US rate but MPMs cannot regulate the international borrowing. The introduction of capital flow management measures (CFMs) can help MPMs in managing corporate loans since they regulate capital inflows directly. My findings from a two-period model are consistent with the empirical evidence. I find that a special case of MPM, concentration limits, can effectively reduce the level and the growth of corporate loans when there is a decrease in the world interest rate. However, the effects of the MPM are dampened when firms are allowed to increase foreign borrowing, which can be resolved with the introduction of CFMs. An additional constraint imposed by a CFM can set a lower bound for a measure of the effectiveness of MPMs by limiting firms from borrowing overly from abroad.</font></p>

						<p align = "justify"><b>"The Yield Curve and Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy"</b> 
							<font> [Pre-Doctoral]</font> <a href="papers/ma.pdf"> [Draft]</a> </p>   
						<p align = "justify"style= "line-height: 1.3"><font size="-0.5">This paper analyzes co-movements among the yield curves of small open countries, and the efficiency of each country’s monetary policy. First, I estimate a dynamic factor model to find common movements among the yield curves of six small open countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The empirical results show that nominal interest rates of the countries are well-accounted for by their US counterpart, rather than the small open countries’ policy rates at long maturities. This may imply that the long-term rates decouple from the short-term policy rates in the small open countries, resulting in limited effects of the countries’ monetary policy. Thus, to examine the effectiveness of monetary policy, I analyze dynamic responses of macro variables to monetary expansions in Canada and Norway. Estimating a vector auto-regression (VAR) model, I conclude that the high yield curve correlations with the United States reduce the impacts of expansionary monetary policy in small open countries. Norway, whose interest rates are the least explained by the US rates, succeeds in boosting its economy by decreasing the policy rate. On the other hand, Canada, which has the highest yield curve correlations with its US counterpart, fails to invigorate economic activities by monetary expansion.</font></p>
