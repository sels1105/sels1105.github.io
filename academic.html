						<p align = "justify"> <b>"Dollar Invoicing and the Global Financial Cycle" </b>
							<i><font size = "-0.5">(work in progress)</font></i></p>   
						<p align = "justify">Most international trade is invoiced in the US dollar. This paper studies variations in dollar in- voicing over time and the role of the global financial cycle. I present three stylized facts about the dynamic movements of invoicing and borrowing currency decisions. First, dollar invoicing shares in exports posi- tively co-move with dollar borrowing shares of firms. Second, both dollar borrowing and dollar invoicing shares positively co-move with the VIX, where dollar borrowing shares are more strongly correlated with the VIX than dollar invoicing shares. Third, countries with higher correlations between shares of dollar bor- rowing and the VIX also have higher correlations between dollar invoicing shares in exports and the VIX. Based on these stylized facts, I develop a model with dollar borrowing as a key channel that links dollar invoicing in exports and the global financial cycle. The key mechanism is that as dollar borrowing becomes cheaper during the global financial downturns, firms invoice more of their exports in dollars to secure dollar revenues that are used as collateral to increase dollar borrowing. The calibrated model fits the stylized facts well, and also provides additional testable implications.</p>

						<p align = "justify"> <b>"Corporate Cross-border Borrowing and Macroprudential Policy" </b>
							<i><font size = "-0.5">(working paper)</font></i></p> 	
						<p align = "justify">This paper present both empirical and theoretical analyses about the effects of macroprudential policy measures (MPMs). I first examine the effectiveness of MPMs in mitigating the response of corporate loans to a US monetary expansion, using panel data constructed from Dealscan database, IMF macropruden- tial policy index (MPI), and other macro variables. I find that MPMs can effectively attenuate the increase in corporate loans responding to a US monetary expansion, but the effects are dampened as the countryâ€™s share of foreign loans goes up. This is because firms borrow more across borders with a decrease in the US rate but MPMs cannot regulate the international borrowing. The introduction of capital flow management measures (CFMs) can help MPMs in managing corporate loans since they regulate capital inflows directly. My findings from a two-period model are consistent with the empirical evidence. I find that a special case of MPM, concentration limits, can effectively reduce the level and the growth of corporate loans when there is a decrease in the world interest rate. However, the effects of the MPM are dampened when firms are allowed to increase foreign borrowing, which can be resolved with the introduction of CFMs. An additional constraint imposed by a CFM can set a lower bound for a measure of the effectiveness of MPMs by limiting firms from borrowing overly from abroad.</p>
